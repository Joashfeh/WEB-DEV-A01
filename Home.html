            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Currently studying Game Development & Technology in Nanyang Polytechnic, I aspire to work in the field of Interactive Reality.
                <br>
                My goal is to study Computer Science in university and further my studies in Interactive Reality.
                I love to see myself improving the current era of mixed reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started taking an interest in programming after watching algorithm visualisations videos. As a logical thinker, I like to come up with unique solutions to different
                problems that can be solved by code. I made the decision to pursue a Diploma in Game Development as I am an avid gamer myself, and I would always try to
                understand different methods used by developers to implement certain mechanics in a game, thus coming to the conclusion that I would be more than happy to work
                in this industry in the future.
